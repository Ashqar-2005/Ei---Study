# 🛰️ Satellite Command System

---

## 🌟 Why This Project Exists
Instead of just being another coding exercise, this project is a mini‑simulation of real aerospace challenges.  
It shows how I think about state management, dependencies, and system design — skills that matter in any engineering role.

---

## 🚀 What It Can Do
- Rotate the satellite (North, South, East, West)  
- Switch solar panels on/off  
- Collect data (only when panels are active)  
- Maintain and update state across commands  

---

## 🧩 What Makes My Approach Different
- **Design Thinking:** I treated the satellite like a real system with dependencies (panels must be active before data collection).  
- **SOLID Principles:** Code is modular and extendable — adding new commands is simple.  
- **Error Handling:** Built‑in checks prevent invalid operations.  
- **Logging:** Every command leaves a trace, just like in mission control.

## 📊 Example Mission Log

> rotate("South")
> activatePanels()
> collectData()

---

## 📊 Final State
- **Orientation:** South  
- **Solar Panels:** Active  
- **Data Collected:** 10  

---

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Language:** Java (object‑oriented design)
- **Patterns:** Command Pattern + State Management  
- **Extras:** Logging, exception handling

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to design systems that mirror real‑world constraints  
- The importance of clean abstractions for long‑term maintainability  
- Thinking like an engineer, not just a coder
